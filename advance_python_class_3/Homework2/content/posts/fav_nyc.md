# Some Faves
## [The Smith](http://thesmithrestaurant.com/)

Probably my favorite restaurant in New York, for so many reasons. Great cocktails, great food, reasonable (for NYC) price point for a good meal, and just always a great time. My favorite place to take people, especially because they've got a few choice locations so it's usually near something.

Pro-tip: ALWAYS get the jalapeno cheddar grits.

## [Sushi Dojo](http://www.sushidojonyc.restaurant/)

Had omakase dinner here for a friend's birthday and it's one of the top 3 food experiences I've ever had in my life.

## [Boulud Sud](https://www.bouludsud.com/)

A good friend used to work here and the food is spectacular. They also have a really good genever-based cocktail list, as well as just great other cocktails as well. My fave: the From the Field - it's basically just gin, lemon, and some lavendar bitters, but it tastes like walking through a medow with the sun on your face.

# Flatiron

## [Eataly](https://www.eataly.com/us_en/stores/new-york/)

Specifically La Rosticceria - their prime rib sandwich is amazing. Coma-inducing, but amazing.

## [Snowfox](http://snowfoxcafe.com/)

Best to-go sushi. The mixed nigiri is my jam.


# Astoria
## [The Pomeroy](http://www.thepomeroynyc.com/)

Great food and cocktails, have yet to try brunch but I'm sure it's delightful.

## [Taverna Kyclades](https://www.zagat.com/r/taverna-kyclades-new-york)

Some of the best Greek food in all of NYC. Be warned: they don't de-bone their fish. Totally worth it though.

##[Alba's Pizza](http://albapizza.com/)

Go-to slice on the way home. The white pizza is delicious.
