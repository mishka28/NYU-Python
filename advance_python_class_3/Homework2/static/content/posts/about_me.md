title: Class Markdown - About Me
date: 2017-10-13

####This was the first markdown file I ever made for class. I've added a few links, so obviously it's now magnificent.

## Sarah Black
#### Project manager for the [AppNexus](https://www.appnexus.com/en) CorpIT Systems group; (crappy but overjoyed) [dancer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS38cB0XSEg); (lazy) [mma fighter](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCHMFDkquyv/?taken-by=tinysarahsaurus); feels like she's writing a dating profile right now.

### Motivation
My boss told me to, but also I wanted to. Got a lot of reporting that needs to be automated and no one else is going to do it for me.

### Area of interest
Not sure at the moment - I'll see what I can do with Python at my job and just sort of see where it takes me. I'm not looking to go into a new field, just looking to have more tools at my disposal to do my current job better.

### Fun Facts
1. I grew up in Rye, 45 minutes outside the city
2. I love to dance but in the ~26 years I've been doing it, I've never been very good
3. I would subsist on carbs, cheese, and burgers alone if it were possible. But alternately, I love nothing more than a really spectacularly delicious fancy meal with friends.
4. [Gif not jif](../gif_not_jif/)
5. I genuinely believe that seltzer is better than regular water

### Favorite movie
I hate this question. I don't have one favorite movie, it completely depends on my mood. But some that are in my list of favorites that I've recently watched are: Her, Bone Collector, The Avengers, Charlie's Angels, again, I have very wide tastes.

### Dream project
I don't have dreams.

Aka I just want to figure out the stuff I know I want to do, haven't thought much beyond that.
